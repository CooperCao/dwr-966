       				<br />SAMBA is the protocol by which a lot of PC-related machines share files and printers and other information such as lists of available files and printers.
       				<br />
       				<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; Before designating a shared folder, you will need to enable the SAMBA server function:
       				<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; Enable SAMBA: Select this check box to enable SAMBA.
       				<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; SAMBA Server Name: The maximum server name length is limited to 15 characters. Users can browse the shared folders by the SAMBA Server Name.
       				<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; User Account: The account for accessing the SAMBA server. Current user accounts are "admin" and "all". The "all" user account does not require a password; the "admin" user account requires a User Password.
       				<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; User Password: The password of the "admin" user account used to access the SAMBA server.
       				<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; Display Password: Displays the User Password when the check box is selected.
       				<br />
       				<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187; To designate a shared folder for file sharing:
       				<br />You can designate a folder within the USB storage device to serve as a shared folder. Computers connected to the DWR-966 will then be able to browse the shared folder by typing "\\[DWR-966's LAN IP address]\[Sharing Profile Name]" or "\\[SAMBA Server Name]\[Sharing Profile Name]" in your browser's address field.
       				<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; 1. Insert the USB storage device into the USB port. The information of this USB storage device will be listed in the table at the top of the "USB Storage" page.
       				<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; 2. Click the Add button to display the screen for adding/modifying a sharing profile.
       				<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; 3. The file folders of the connected USB storage device will be listed in the table at bottom of this page. Select the folder that you want to designate as the shared folder. The Folder Path field will automatically populate with the selected path.
       				<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#187;&#187; 4. Enter the information for this sharing profile and click the Apply button to implement this sharing profile.
